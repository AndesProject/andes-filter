# Andes Filter

### Description

This project aims to develop a filtering library that allows developers to apply complex filters and
conditions to data collections in an intuitive and programmatic way. By using objects to define
conditions, users can combine logical and relational operators, making it easy to construct queries
and manage data efficiently and at scale. The library is developed in TypeScript, ensuring type
safety and modern JavaScript features for enhanced developer experience and performance.

### Features
